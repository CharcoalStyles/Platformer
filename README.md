Platformer
==========

A testbed for platformer-ing in AS3/Flixel

The current buildable version shows:
-loading a level and tileset from a website.
-Speration of character and accessory (in this case, hat)

If I remember correctly, there's also:
-seperation of a player character's bod and their animated head.
-code for Super Meat Boy style replays.
-loading levels through the DAME level editor. http://dambots.com/dame-editor
And quite possibly a few other things.
